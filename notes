- Add a landing page which is shown if the user opens the extension manually
    - If the current page is scanned it should show stats
        - green-white color scheme if site is legit
        - red-white color scheme and warning if site is malicious
    - If the current domain isn't scanned it should show a loading spinner until the timeout expires and results are ready (blue-white color scheme)
- Fix the linkage between background script and popup - popup should appear if site is malicious
- Fetch the VT API key from local storage
- Implement a form shown on extension install to enter own VT API key which will be saved to local storage and used by the extension
